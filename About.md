<!-- # About me -->
There are many levels in which biodiversity can be viewed, such as from genetic or ecosystem perspectives. Perhaps the most important level, however, is that of individual traits because it provides a link between heritable genetic variation and individual fitness, modulated by environmental factors. Interactions are the rule in biodiversity. Genes can interact through epistasis to produce quantitative trait variation and/or they can interact physically via their juxtaposition along a given chromosome. The core of my research focuses on identifying how these two types of genetic interactions relate to variation in fitness and facilitate (or impede) local adaptation.
