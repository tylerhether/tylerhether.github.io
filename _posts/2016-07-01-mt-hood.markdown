Before moving to the Beaver State, I read Douglas Lorain's book [*100 Classic Hikes in Oregon*](https://books.google.com/books?id=eCV2jzmN0A8C&dq=100+classic+hikes+in+oregon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpyq2M-q_NAhUY7WMKHTP7AloQ6AEIKzAB). My favorite thing about that book is that the colored pictures provide great snapshots of scenic waterfalls and vistas -- which are great for planning out trips -- but it still leaves plenty of natural beauty to be discovered in person. And much of Oregon's beauty involves Mount Hood!

My friend Amy and I took the [scenic loop](http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5227071.pdf) around Mt. Hood. From I84, we went south on Highway 35 from Hood River, Oregon. Along 35 there are many car camping places to stay -- all with Robin Hood theme names. The last two campgrounds ("Sherwood" and "Robinhood") offer plenty of space for camping and abut Hood River. We ventured west along Highway 26 and looped back along LoLo Pass Road. Lolo Pass quickly transitioned into an unpaved forest service road where I was lucky to be driving a Subaru. This seldom used road offers some unique perspectives of Mt. Hood.

We wrapped up the loop by taking a short detour to Lost Lake, which is famous for its [unique lake](http://www.amusingplanet.com/2015/09/oregon-lost-lake-disappears-each-summer.html) and gorgeous views of the mountain.
