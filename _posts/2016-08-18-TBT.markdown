For this throwback Thursday I'm linking [*this BEACON blog post*](https://www3.beacon-center.org/blog/2012/04/10/beacon-researchers-at-work-effect-of-landscapes-and-ecology-on-gene-flow-and-speciation/) from 2012. It summarizes some of the work I did using [*Machine Learning*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and landscape genetics to find habitat correlates of genetic structure in the squirrel treefrog (_Hyla squirella_).
