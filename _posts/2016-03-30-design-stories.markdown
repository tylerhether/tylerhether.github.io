So...

I'm switching my website over from google sites to github. Using the [*jekyll*](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} template [*Gravity*](https://github.com/hemangsk/Gravity){:target="_blank"}, my new site promises to have a touch of modern compared to the generic, boring google one. Bare with me while I transfer and add content.
