So the last post was more than three years ago! Where have I gone? The very short answer is that I moved to industry and, well, life. Let me unpack that a little bit here while I brush off the cobwebs. I'll give more details in upcoming posts!

We moved to Seattle in March of 2017 so that I can work in biotech. I'd like to include a separate post on academia versus industry at some point but suffice it to say that industry moves at a faster pace, which is definitely a good thing. For obvious reasons I can't give updates on what I'm doing so that's why I've been quiet on that front.

But this site isn't all about data science and I'd like to get back into adventures in family biking, bike camping, kayak camping, and other rad outdoors stuff. For example, while still in Eugene my partner and I were into family biking. In Seattle, we ramped up our involvement in the family biking community. There was some presence in Eugene but Seattle has a fair bit more biking infrastructure  and a family can really get places by bike alone. Again, I'll provide more details in another post.

More soon!
