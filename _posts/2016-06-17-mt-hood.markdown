The Northwest has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the United States. From the amber waves of grain that flow on the Palouse's rolling hills in northern Idaho and eastern Washington to inspiring Cannon Beach in Oregon, there's something for everyone to enjoy.

<!-- Before moving to the Beaver State, I read Douglas Lorain's book [*100 Classic Hikes in Oregon*](https://books.google.com/books?id=eCV2jzmN0A8C&dq=100+classic+hikes+in+oregon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpyq2M-q_NAhUY7WMKHTP7AloQ6AEIKzAB). My favorite thing about that book is that the colored pictures provide great snapshots of scenic waterfalls and vistas -- which are great for planning out trips -- but it still leaves plenty of natural beauty to be discovered in person.   -->

Shortly after moving to Oregon I had a chance to spend a weekend in the Colombia River Gorge. Just off of Exit 41 on interstate 84, not to far east of Portland, is a trailhead that follows Eagle Creek. The trail itself is a little intense. First, there are certain cliffs on the trail that just, well, drop off. While there's no guardrails to be found, the trail does have wire handrails in the sketchiest regions. Second, the knobbly stones that make up the trail will make you wish you brought your most supportive hiking boots.

The temperature on the day we arrived to Eagle Creek was flirting with the mid 90s and so the trail was crowded with other backpackers and day hikers trying to escape the heat in the cool creek. A few miles into the trail is Punch Bowl Falls, where the cobblestone beach that sits just downstream is a popular hangout for families and college students alike.

In stark contrast to the populous lower creek that would make you wonder if you were in a theme park, the rest of Eagle Creek trail leading up to Tunnel Falls was calm and quiet. The tunnel itself (see image at the top of the page) was easily the best part of the trip.

We originally aimed to camp overnight at a campsite 7 miles in; however, on 3 occasions throughout the day we were stopped by other hikers warning us to turn back. A rash of vehicle break ins had resulted in backpackers coming back to smashed windows. Indeed, we arrived back at the trailhead and notice that the cars left overnight were robbed. It's such a shame. One of the best things about backpacking is alleviating stress and anxiety -- something that is impossible if you're worried about your automobile the whole time. Taking a bus from Portland might be a great alternative to leaving your car unattended.
