Short update here. Moving to larger and larger model organisms, I started working with nematodes when I started my postdoc. Before this week, however, my exposure with them was in the form of analyzing their DNA so the benchwork has been a mystery to me. It turns out that these guys -- or rather hermaphrodites -- have so many interesting behaviors and phenotypes! More on this topic in a future post!
