        <title>Mt Hood</title>
        <description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Mt Hood on Highway 35. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving to the Beaver State, I read Douglas Lorain’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=eCV2jzmN0A8C&amp;amp;dq=100+classic+hikes+in+oregon&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpyq2M-q_NAhUY7WMKHTP7AloQ6AEIKzAB&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;100 Classic Hikes in Oregon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. My favorite thing about that book is that the colored pictures provide great snapshots of scenic waterfalls and vistas – which are great for planning out trips – but it still leaves plenty of natural beauty to be discovered in person. And much of Oregon’s beauty involves Mount Hood!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Amy and I took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5227071.pdf&quot;&gt;scenic loop&lt;/a&gt; around Mt. Hood. From I84, we went south on Highway 35 from Hood River, Oregon. Along 35 there are many car camping places to stay – all with Robin Hood theme names. The last two campgrounds (“Sherwood” and “Robinhood”) offer plenty of space for camping and abut Hood River. We ventured west along Highway 26 and looped back along LoLo Pass Road. Lolo Pass quickly transitioned into an unpaved forest service road where I was lucky to be driving a Subaru. This seldom used road offers some unique perspectives of Mt. Hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up the loop by taking a short detour to Lost Lake, which is famous for its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amusingplanet.com/2015/09/oregon-lost-lake-disappears-each-summer.html&quot;&gt;unique lake&lt;/a&gt; and gorgeous views of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eagle Creek</title>
        <description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7602/26885151053_3b35d37b63_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Tunnel Falls. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northwest has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the United States. From the amber waves of grain that flow on the Palouse’s rolling hills in northern Idaho and eastern Washington to inspiring Cannon Beach in Oregon, there’s something for everyone to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Before moving to the Beaver State, I read Douglas Lorain&#39;s book [*100 Classic Hikes in Oregon*](https://books.google.com/books?id=eCV2jzmN0A8C&amp;dq=100+classic+hikes+in+oregon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpyq2M-q_NAhUY7WMKHTP7AloQ6AEIKzAB). My favorite thing about that book is that the colored pictures provide great snapshots of scenic waterfalls and vistas -- which are great for planning out trips -- but it still leaves plenty of natural beauty to be discovered in person.   --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after moving to Oregon I had a chance to spend a weekend in the Colombia River Gorge. Just off Exit 41 on interstate 84, not too far east of Portland, is a trailhead that follows Eagle Creek. The trail itself is a little intense. First, there are certain cliffs on the trail that just, well, drop off. While there’s no guardrails to be found, the trail does have wire handrails in the sketchiest regions. Second, the knobbly stones that make up the trail will make you wish you brought your most supportive hiking boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7405/27420933571_50175e7522_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Stones scattered along the trail. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temperature on the day we arrived to Eagle Creek was flirting with the mid 90s and so the trail was crowded with other backpackers and day hikers trying to escape the heat in the cool creek. A few miles into the trail is Punch Bowl Falls, where the cobblestone beach that sits just downstream is a popular hangout for families and college students alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/26885143603_1f702d2673_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i&gt; A view from the trail looking down over Punch Bowl Falls &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7223/27458465796_a408627ef9_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;i&gt; Punch Bowl Falls from the beach &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to the populous lower creek that would make you wonder if you were in a theme park, the rest of Eagle Creek trail leading up to Tunnel Falls was calm and quiet. The tunnel itself (see image at the top of the page) was easily the best part of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We originally aimed to camp overnight at a campsite 7 miles in; however, on 3 occasions throughout the day we were stopped by other hikers warning us to turn back. A rash of vehicle break ins had resulted in backpackers coming back to smashed windows. Indeed, we arrived back at the trailhead and notice that the cars left overnight were robbed. It’s such a shame. One of the best things about backpacking is alleviating stress and anxiety – something that is impossible if you’re worried about your automobile the whole time. Taking a bus from Portland might be a great alternative to leaving your car unattended.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Website | Adapted from Gravity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m switching my website over from google sites to github. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;jekyll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; template &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hemangsk/Gravity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gravity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, my new site promises to have a touch of modern compared to the generic, boring google one. Bare with me while I transfer and add content.&lt;/p&gt;
